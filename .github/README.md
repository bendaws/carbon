# carbon-experiments-repo
This hosts my experiments with the Carbon language. I want to learn Carbon quickly as C++ is not my favorite language ever.

## Resources
If you want to start learning Carbon, there are resources online to do so.

- [Carbon Offical Repository](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang): Offical documentation. If you know C++, this is the place to start.
- [This specific comparison (Carbon and C++)](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang/tree/trunk?tab=readme-ov-file#carbon-and-c) helped me personally.

## License
No license here, just a bunch of code.
